# TAZ-6-Dual-Mosquito

This is a custom configuration of the marlin Bugfix 2.0.x Firmware for the Lulzbot TAZ 6 that is upgraded using dual Slice Engineering Mosquito Hotend and the Bondtech BMG-X2-M.

This was a custom upgrade that I don't think has been done before, and therefore there are still a ton of edits and optimization s that I have to make for it.
